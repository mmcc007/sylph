_A sylph is a mythological invisible being of the air._

# _Sylph_
_Sylph_ is a command line utility for running Flutter integration and end-to-end tests on pools of real iOS and Android devices in the cloud. _Sylph_ runs on mac, linux and windows and also in a CI environment. 

_Sylph_ works with AWS Device Farm for up to hundreds of Android and iOS devices in a single run.

# Dependencies
## AWS CLI
Install AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)

MacOS/Linux:
```
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
unzip awscli-bundle.zip
sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
``` 

Windows:
```
pip install  awscli 
```

For alternative install options see:  
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html

## AWS CLI Credentials
Configure the AWS CLI credentials:
```
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
```
For alternative configuration options see:  
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html

## Test AWS CLI
Confirm AWS CLI is installed and configured correctly by running an AWS command. For example, the following command should generate output:
```
aws devicefarm list-projects
```

# Configuration
Configuration information is passed to _Sylph_ using a configuration file. The default config file is called `sylph.yaml`:
```yaml
# Config file for Flutter tests on real device pools.
# Auto-creates projects and device pools if needed.
# Configures android and ios test runs.
# Builds app, uploads and runs tests.
# Then monitors tests, returns final pass/fail result and downloads artifacts.
# Note: assumes the 'aws' command line utility is logged-in.
# Note: to build the debug iOS app, certain environment variables are required.

# sylph config
tmp_dir: /tmp/sylph
artifacts_dir: /tmp/sylph_artifacts
# local timeout per device farm run
sylph_timeout: 720 # seconds approx
# run on ios and android pools concurrently (for faster results)
concurrent_runs: true

# device farm config
project_name: App Integration Tests
default_job_timeout: 10 # minutes, set at project creation

device_pools:

  - pool_name: android pool 1
    pool_type: android
    devices:
      - name: Google Pixel 2
        model: Google Pixel 2
        os: 8.0.0

  - pool_name: ios pool 1
    pool_type: ios
    devices:
      - name: Apple iPhone X
        model: A1865
        os: 11.4

test_suites:

  - test_suite: example tests 1
    main: test_driver/main.dart
    tests:
      - test_driver/main_test.dart
    pool_names:
      - android pool 1
      - ios pool 1
    job_timeout: 15 # minutes, set per job, over-rides default job timeout above

```
Multiple test suites, consisting of multiple tests, can be run on each device in each device pool. The 'main' app must include a call to `enableFlutterDriverExtension()`. 

Device pools can consist of multiple devices. Devices in a device pool must be of the same type, iOS or Android.

Note: If running on linux or windows, tests can only be run on Android devices. To run tests on both Android and iOS use a mac CI provider.

## Building an iOS debug app
To build a testable iOS app locally, that can run on any real device in the cloud, the following environment variable must be present:

- TEAM_ID  
This is the Developer Portal Team ID. It is of the form 'ABCDEFGHIJ'.

A check is made before the start of a run to confirm this environment variable is present.

Note: if not running on an iOS pool this environment variable is not required.

## Populating a device pool
To add devices to a device pool, pick devices from the list provided by
```
sylph -d android
or
sylph -d ios
```
and add to the appropriate pool type in sylph.yaml. The listed devices are devices currently available on Device Farm.

## Configuration Validation
The sylph.yaml is validated to confirm the devices are  available on Device Farm and tests are present before starting a run. 

If running on an iOS pool, the iOS-related environment variables must be defined. 

## Configuring Flavors
A reference flavor app can be found in [example/flavors](example/flavors). It is taken from https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/dev/integration_tests/flavors and works for android and iOS. It is currently recommended that you follow this pattern when implementing flavors in your app.

To enable testing on a flavor add the following to your sylph.yaml:
```
flavor: <name of flavor>
```

##Â Flutter version

Sylph will default to flutter version `v1.12.13+hotfix.8-stable` to execute the tests in AWS but this can be overriden by setting the `FLUTTER_VERSION` environment variable to the version of your choice.

# Configuring a CI Environment for _Sylph_
In addition to running from the command line, _Sylph_ also runs in a CI environment.

## AWS CLI Credentials for CI
The following AWS CLI credentials are required in a CI environment:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

For details on other credentials see:  
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html

## iOS builds
To build the iOS app, the provisioning profile and certificate must be installed on the CI build machine. To install these dependencies, Fastlane's match is used. _Sylph_ will detect it is running in a CI environment (using the 'CI' environment variable), and will install fastlane and fastlane scripts. The scripts  are used to install the dependencies using Fastlane's match. The iOS build can then complete as normal.

The following environment variables are required by a CI build to use Fastlane match:
- PUBLISHING_MATCH_CERTIFICATE_REPO  
This is the location of the private match repo. It expects an ssh-based url. For example, ssh://git@private.mycompany.com/private_repos/match.git  
- MATCH_PASSWORD  
This is the password that was used to encrypt the git repo's contents during match setup.

For details on how to setup Match see:  
https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/

The following are required by sylph in a CI environment to connect to the match host. The match host is running a ssh server that connects to the git server which serves the match repo. This configuration is required so that PUBLISHING_MATCH_CERTIFICATE_REPO will work via ssh:
- SSH_SERVER  
This is used to configure the CI's ssh client to find the match host. For example, private.mycompany.com.
- SSH_SERVER_PORT  
This is used to configure the CI's ssh client to find the match host's ssh port. For example, 22.

As with running from the command line, the following environment variable is also required by _Sylph_ in a CI environment:
- TEAM_ID  
This is the Developer Portal Team ID. It is of the form 'ABCDEFGHIJ'.

Note: if not running on an iOS pool all iOS-related environment variables are not required.

## Sample environment variables for Travis-CI
For example, when _Sylph_ is run on Travis-CI the following environment variables are used:

![secret variables](art/travis_env_vars.png)

See [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) for running _Sylph_ on Travis-CI.

Note: the Travis-CI build uses pre-configured AWS CLI values in [.aws/config](.aws/config).

# Upgrade
To upgrade, simply re-issue the install command
````bash
$ pub global activate sylph
````
To check the version of _Sylph_ currently installed:
```
pub global list
```
# Live demo
To see _Sylph_ in action in a CI environment, a  demo of the [example](example) app is available.
